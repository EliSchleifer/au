This is for two main groups of users: Those who want to contribute to the library, either the code or the docs. Those who want to work through the tutorial exercises . Tip If all you want to do is install the library in your project, you can simply use our installation guide . Core development setup \u00b6 These steps are common to all workflows. Step 0: Decide whether to fork \u00b6 If you\u2019re confident that you want to contribute , you should start out by forking the repository. This gives you your own copy which you can modify, and from which you can create pull requests to share your changes with the main repository. Here are GitHub\u2019s instructions for forking . Everyone else can simply skip this step and work directly from the main repository. If you decide later on to make a pull request, you\u2019ll still need to create a fork, but it\u2019s easy to set it up after the fact. We\u2019ll provide detailed instructions below. Instructions for switching an existing clone to a fork If you\u2019re here, you probably cloned the main repository directly, and then later decided to make a pull request. For that, you\u2019ll need to switch your origin remote to point to your fork instead of the main repository. You can directly use the instructions below, which we adapted from this guide . Create the fork on GitHub. You will need to note the name of your fork, in the format user_name/repo_name . Typically, the user_name part will be replaced with your GitHub username, and the repo_name part will simply be au . Rename origin to upstream . We still want to track the main repository; we just need to give it a different name. Run this command verbatim: git remote rename origin upstream Make your fork the new origin . Your command will start with git remote add origin , and end with a URL for your repository. If your GitHub username were user_name , the full command should look like this: git remote add origin git@github.com:user_name/au.git # ^^^^^^^^^ # Example only: remember to replace user name! Fetch from origin . Run this command verbatim: git fetch origin Track origin from main . Run this command verbatim: git branch -u origin/main main At this point, you should be able to create a pull request in the usual way, simply by pushing a local branch to your fork via the origin remote. Step 1: Clone the repository \u00b6 This step gets the Au source code onto your machine. The precise details depend on whether you decided to fork or not in the previous step. Did you fork, or not? No fork (default) Fork This is for users who just want to work through the tutorials, or play around with the code. git clone https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au.git Follow GitHub\u2019s cloning instructions , using the fork you created as the repository. Whichever approach you took, you should have a folder named au/ in your current directory which contains the Au source code. Step 2: Set up direnv \u00b6 direnv is a tool that makes it easy to use the correct version of every tool we use: bazel , clang-format , buildifier , and other project-specific ones like make-single-file and au-docs-serve . It will add these tools to your $PATH , but only when you\u2019re inside your copy of the repository. What if you skip this step? This step is optional, but highly recommended. If you skip this step, you\u2019ll need to prepend tools/bin/ to every command that comes from Au\u2019s tools directory. For example, Replace bazel with tools/bin/bazel . Replace clang-format with tools/bin/clang-format . And so on. The first step to set up direnv is to install the tool itself, using their installation instructions . The next time you enter your Au folder, you\u2019ll get a warning message like this: direnv: error .envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content. Simply do what it says and run direnv allow , and you\u2019re all set! Testing your installation You can test that everything\u2019s working by running bazel --version inside your Au folder. You should get a result compatible with the current contents of the .bazelversion file. For example, at the time of writing, we\u2019re on bazel 5.3.0, so this command produces the output: bazel 5.3.0 Specific workflows \u00b6 Now that your basic development setup is complete, here are some types of workflows you can do. Building and testing the code \u00b6 To build and test the entire repository, run bazel test //...:all . Note The first time you run any command such as bazel , there may be some additional overhead from downloading or configuring the tool itself. This is a one-time cost, and each subsequent run should be fast. You can also specify any number of specific targets or target patterns, using bazel\u2019s target syntax . For example, if you wanted to test the core library code (which lives in //au ), and test the generated single-file package (whose target is //release:au_hh_test ), you could write: bazel test //au:all //release:au_hh_test Using different toolchains \u00b6 Au comes pre-packaged with support for several different compiler toolchains. To use a specific toolchain \u2014 say, X \u2014 pass it as a --config=X argument. For example, here\u2019s how you would run all of the tests using gcc 10: bazel test --config = gcc10 //...:all Here are the possible values we support for --config : --config value compiler clang14 Clang 14 (default) clang11 Clang 11 gcc10 gcc 10 What if your preferred compiler isn\u2019t in this list? Our goal is for Au to work with any standards-compliant compiler that fully supports C++14, or any later language standard. We\u2019ve had good results with a variety of compilers already, so we recommend simply trying Au in yours! If you do, and you find a bug, please feel free to file an issue. If the compiler is fully C++14-compatible, we\u2019ll do our best to find a fix, or an acceptable workaround. We may also consider adding the compiler to our officially supported list, as long as we can use it via a hermetic bazel toolchain. Building and viewing documentation \u00b6 It\u2019s easy to set up a local version of the documentation website. Simply run the included command, au-docs-serve . Here\u2019s some example output: INFO: Analyzed target //:update_docs (0 packages loaded, 0 targets configured). INFO: Found 1 target... Target //:update_docs up-to-date: bazel-bin/update_docs INFO: Elapsed time: 0.309s, Critical Path: 0.06s INFO: 1 process: 1 internal.

The command stays running until you interrupt it (typically via Ctrl-C , or the equivalent on your terminal ). Note that as long as it stays running, it will automatically regenerate the website whenever you edit any file, and the browser will automatically reload the page! Viewing documentation on a remote machine Some users connect to a remote machine via ssh to do their development. In this case, au-docs-serve won\u2019t work out of the box. The reason is that it\u2019s running on your remote machine, but your web browser is on your local machine. When you try to open the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/au/ , which points to the local machine , it can\u2019t find the web server, because it\u2019s running on the remote machine. The solution is to forward the port, 8000 , when you connect to your remote machine. If you do, then local requests on that port will be forwarded along to the remote machine, where the web server is running. Here\u2019s how you do that. Find your usual ssh command. This is whatever you run on your local machine to connect to the remote host. For example, if your username is user and your remote hostname is remote.host , this might look like the following: ssh user@remote.host Add an option for port forwarding. Expanding on the previous example, this would be: ssh -L 8000 :localhost:8000 user@remote.host # ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Note: this is added Run au-docs-serve on the remote host. Naturally, you\u2019ll need to be in your Au folder to do this. At this point, as long as that command stays running on your remote host, you should be able to visit the URL in your local browser, and view the documentation website.","title":"Development Setup"},{"location":"develop/#development-setup","text":"This page explains how to set up the repository for development.

First, we\u2019ll help you decide which one is right for you. Then, we\u2019ll provide full instructions for each option. Broadly, you can either do a \u201cfull install\u201d of the library, or you can package it into a single header file. For the latter approach, there are two options: Pre-built versions you can download right away. Custom versions with exactly the units you choose. Choosing a method \u00b6 You should consider several factors before you decide how to install the Au library, such as: Tradeoffs in setup time, unit selection, and flexibility. Whether you\u2019re installing for production, or just trying it out. Your build system. Here\u2019s an overview of the tradeoffs involved. Legend Unsupported Fair Good Best Single File Full Install Pre-built Custom bazel CMake, conan, vcpkg, ... Setup time ~1 min ~10 min ~10 min Not yet supported (use single-file instead for now) Unit selection Base units only Any units desired Any units desired, without needing \"reinstall\" Compile time cost ~10 units Very competitive up to a few dozen units Each file only pays for the units it uses Flexibility Awkward: would need to download io.hh and/or testing.hh separately, and modify their includes manually Include I/O, testing utilities, individual units as desired, on a per-file basis So, which should you use? graph TD Usage[What's your use case?] SetupTime[Got 10 minutes for setup?] BuildSystem[What's your build system?] UsePreBuilt[Use pre-built single file] UseCustom[Use custom single file] UseFullInstall[Use full install] Usage -->|Just playing around with Au| SetupTime SetupTime -->|No! Just let me start!| UsePreBuilt SetupTime -->|Sure| UseCustom Usage -->|Ready to use in my project!| BuildSystem BuildSystem -->|bazel| UseFullInstall BuildSystem -->|other| UseCustom Installation instructions \u00b6 Here are the instructions for each installation method we support. Single file \u00b6 The Au library can be packaged as a single header file, which you can include in your project just like any other header. This works with any build system! To take this approach, obtain the single file by one of the methods described below. Then, put it inside a third_party folder (for example, as third_party/au.hh ). Now you\u2019re up and running with Au! Every single-file package automatically includes the following features: Warning Before public release, we should ensure each of the following items has a documentation page, and link to that page here: Basic \u201cunit container\u201d types: Quantity , QuantityPoint Magnitude types and values, including the constant PI , and constants for any integer such as mag<5280>() . All prefixes for SI ( kilo , mega , \u2026) and informational ( kibi , mebi , \u2026) quantities. Math functions, including unit-aware rounding and inverses, trigonometric functions, square roots, and so on. Bidirectional implicit conversion between Quantity types and any equivalent counterparts in the std::chrono library. Here are the two ways to get a single-file packaging of the library. Pre-built single file \u00b6 Tip This approach is mainly for playing with the library. It\u2019s very fast to get up and running, but it\u2019s not the best choice as the \u201cproduction\u201d installation of your library. For a single-file approach, most users will be much better served by the next section, which explains how to customize it to get exactly the units you want. We provide pre-generated single-file versions of the library, automatically generated from the latest commit in the repo: au.hh au_noio.hh (Same as above, but with <iostream> support stripped out) These include very few units (to keep compile times short). However, combinations of these units should get you any other unit you\u2019re likely to want. The units we include are: Every SI base unit ( seconds , meters , kilo(grams) , amperes , kelvins , moles , candelas ) Base units for angles and information ( radians , bits ) A base dimensionless unit ( unos ) Note How do you go about constructing other units from these? By composing them. For example, you can make other coherent SI units like this: constexpr auto newtons = kilo ( gram ) * meters / squared ( second ); Now you can call, say, newtons(10) and get a quantity equivalent to 10 Newtons. You can also scale a unit by multiplying by Magnitude objects. For example: constexpr auto degrees = radians * PI / mag < 180 > (); These will \u201cwork\u201d, in the sense of producing correct results. But these ad hoc unit definitions are far less usable than fully defined units . Both the type names and the unit symbols will be needlessly complicated. Again, we recommend following the directions in the next section to get exactly the units you care about. Custom single file \u00b6 It\u2019s easy to package the library in a custom single file with exactly the units you need. Here\u2019s how: Clone the repo . Go to the aurora-opensource/au repo, and follow the typical instructions. If you\u2019re just a user of Au, not a contributor , this should be: git clone https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au.git Run the script . tools/bin/make-single-file --units meters seconds newtons > ~/au.hh creates a file, ~/au.hh , which packages the entire library in a single file with these three units. To see the full list of available units, search the .hh files in the au/units/ folder. For example, meters will include the contents of au/units/meters.hh . Provide the --noio flag if you prefer to avoid the expense of the <iostream> library. Now you have a file, ~/au.hh , which you can add to your third_party folder. Full library installation \u00b6 bazel \u00b6 Warning These instructions were written while the Au repo was still private. Therefore, we couldn\u2019t fully test that they actually work . However, when adding a backup file:/// URL pointing to a manually downloaded copy, they did work, which is a very promising sign. Choose your Au version . This can be a tag, or a commit hash. Let\u2019s take 0.2.0 as an example. Form the URL to the archive . For 0.2.0 , this would be: https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au/archive/0.2.0.tar.gz NOTE: Your au version ID goes HERE ^^^^^ Compute your SHA256 hash . Follow the URL from the previous step to download the archive. Compute the SHA256 hash: sha256sum au-0.2.0.tar.gz The first token that appears is the hash. Save it for the next step. Add http_archive rule to WORKSPACE . Follow this pattern: http_archive ( name = \"au\" , sha256 = \"bdaec065b35f44af2cb22def5b69ac08ca40c47791ea3ed2eb3ebf3e85b3e0b0\" , strip_prefix = \"au-0.2.0\" , urls = [ \"https://github.com/aurora-opensource/au/archive/0.2.0.tar.gz\" ], ) In particular, here\u2019s how to fill out the fields: sha256 : Use the SHA256 hash you got from step 3. strip_prefix : write \"au-0.2.0\" , except use your ID from step 1 instead of 0.2.0 . urls : This should be a list, whose only entry is the URL you formed in step 2. At this point, the Au library is installed, and you can use it in your project! Here are the headers provided by each Au target.

For a single-file approach, most users will be much better served by the next section, which explains how to customize it to get exactly the units you want. We provide pre-generated single-file versions of the library, automatically generated from the latest commit in the repo: au.hh au_noio.hh (Same as above, but with <iostream> support stripped out) These include very few units (to keep compile times short). However, combinations of these units should get you any other unit you\u2019re likely to want. The units we include are: Every SI base unit ( seconds , meters , kilo(grams) , amperes , kelvins , moles , candelas ) Base units for angles and information ( radians , bits ) A base dimensionless unit ( unos ) Note How do you go about constructing other units from these? By composing them. For example, you can make other coherent SI units like this: constexpr auto newtons = kilo ( gram ) * meters / squared ( second ); Now you can call, say, newtons(10) and get a quantity equivalent to 10 Newtons. You can also scale a unit by multiplying by Magnitude objects. For example: constexpr auto degrees = radians * PI / mag < 180 > (); These will \u201cwork\u201d, in the sense of producing correct results. But these ad hoc unit definitions are far less usable than fully defined units . Both the type names and the unit symbols will be needlessly complicated.

The intended use case is to help you interpret an actual error in your code , at the point where you encounter it. To use this page, copy some relevant snippets from your compiler error, and then search the text of this page using your browser\u2019s Find function. Tip To improve your chances of finding what you\u2019re looking for, we include full compiler errors from both gcc and clang, inline with the text. Naturally, this makes this page very long, so it\u2019s not meant to be read straight through. Stick with your browser\u2019s Find function. Each section below lists one category of compiler error you might encounter when using the library. It explains what it means and how to solve it, and gives specific snippets of erroneous code, along with the compiler errors that each would yield. Private constructor \u00b6 Meaning: This means you passed a raw numeric value to an interface that expected a Quantity. It\u2019s the \u201cclassic\u201d error the units library aims to prevent. Solution: Call the appropriate Quantity maker: instead of passing x , pass meters(x) , (kilo(meters) / hour)(x) , etc. A note on quantity makers vs. constructors Every other major units library lets you construct its Quantity types from raw numeric values; it just makes that constructor explicit. Au goes further, and makes this constructor private. The reason is to preserve unit safety at all callsites. We can\u2019t know whether you made an alias that doesn\u2019t name the unit. For example, if you want everybody to measure lengths in Meters in your codebase, you might provide a common alias like this: using Length = QuantityD < Meters > ; If you did, then end users could write the following: constexpr Length MAX_LENGTH { 5.5 }; // Unsafe! Units unclear. :( A core principle of the Au library is that the only way to enter or exit the library boundaries is to name the unit of measure, explicitly, at the callsite, like this: constexpr Length MAX_LENGTH = meters ( 5.5 ); // Usable! Units unambiguous. :) This enables users who want to use this kind of \u201cdimension-named alias\u201d in their codebase to do so safely. Example Code Broken Fixed void set_timeout ( QuantityD < Seconds > dt ); // A (BROKEN): passing raw number where duration expected. set_timeout ( 0.5 ); // B (BROKEN): calling Quantity constructor directly. constexpr QuantityD < Meters > length { 5.5 }; void set_timeout ( QuantityD < Seconds > dt ); // A (FIXED): name the unit. set_timeout ( seconds ( 0.5 )); // B (FIXED): calling Quantity constructor directly. constexpr QuantityD < Meters > length = meters ( 5.5 ); Compiler error (clang 14) au/error_examples.cc:19:17: error: calling a private constructor of class 'au::Quantity<au::Seconds, double>' set_timeout(0.5); ^ ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} ^ au/error_examples.cc:22:33: error: calling a private constructor of class 'au::Quantity<au::Meters, double>' constexpr QuantityD<Meters> length{5.5}; ^ ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} ^ Compiler error (clang 11) au/error_examples.cc:19:17: error: calling a private constructor of class 'au::Quantity<au::Seconds, double>' set_timeout(0.5); ^ ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} ^ au/error_examples.cc:22:33: error: calling a private constructor of class 'au::Quantity<au::Meters, double>' constexpr QuantityD<Meters> length{5.5}; ^ ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} ^ Compiler error (gcc 10) au/error_examples.cc: In function 'void au::example_private_constructor()': au/error_examples.cc:19:20: error: 'constexpr au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Quantity(au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Rep) [with UnitT = au::Seconds; RepT = double; au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Rep = double]' is private within this context 19 | set_timeout(0.5); | ^ In file included from ./au/math.hh:8, from ./au/au.hh:7, from au/error_examples.cc:1: ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here 369 | constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} | ^~~~~~~~ au/error_examples.cc:22:43: error: 'constexpr au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Quantity(au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Rep) [with UnitT = au::Meters; RepT = double; au::Quantity<UnitT, RepT>::Rep = double]' is private within this context 22 | constexpr QuantityD<Meters> length{5.5}; | ^ In file included from ./au/math.hh:8, from ./au/au.hh:7, from au/error_examples.cc:1: ./au/quantity.hh:369:15: note: declared private here 369 | constexpr Quantity(Rep value) : value_{value} {} | ^~~~~~~~ Dangerous conversion \u00b6 Meaning: This is a physically meaningful conversion, but we think the risk of a grossly incorrect answer is too high, so we forbid it. There are two main sources for this risk, both having to do with integral storage types. Inexact conversion . Example: inches(24).as(feet) . Overflow . Example: giga(hertz)(1).as(hertz) . Both of these examples would in fact produce the correct answer with the specific values given ( 24 and 1 ). However, many (most!) other values would not. Thus, we disallow the entire conversion operation (at least in this format). Solution: There are different strategies to solve this, depending on your use case. Use floating point . As mentioned above, these risks only apply to integer values. If floating point is what you want anyway, just use it. giga(hertz)(1.0).as(hertz) produces hertz(1'000'000'000.0) . Use \u201cexplicit Rep\u201d form . The \u201cRep\u201d is the storage type for the Quantity. If you pass it as a template parameter, it is \u201cmorally equivalent\u201d to a static_cast , and has the same \u201cforcing\u201d semantics. inches(24).as<int>(feet) produces feet(2) . Warning Stop and think before using the explicit Rep version. If you\u2019re reviewing code that uses it, ask about it. The library is trying to protect you from an error prone operation. The mechanism exists because sometimes you can know that it\u2019s OK, but remember to stop and check first! Example Code Broken Fixed (1. Floating Point) Fixed (2.

When computing the inverse of an integral quantity in a given target unit, there is some smallest value that will get truncated down to zero (a tremendous error!). If that value is \u201csmall enough to be scary\u201d (currently 1,000), we forbid the conversion. Solution: Consider using floating point; you\u2019ll always get a precise answer. Alternatively, use a smaller target unit. Example Code Broken Fixed (1. Floating point) Fixed (2. Smaller target unit) // (BROKEN): excessive truncation risk. inverse_as ( seconds , hertz ( 5 )); // (FIXED): 1. Floating point result ~= seconds(0.2) inverse_as ( seconds , hertz ( 5.0 )); // (FIXED): 2. Integer result == milli(seconds)(200) inverse_as ( milli ( seconds ), hertz ( 5 )); Note If you\u2019re really sure it\u2019s OK, you can use the explicit-Rep version of inverse_as , which is forcing like a static_cast . This is rarely the right choice, though. Consider: inverse_as < int > ( seconds , hertz ( 5 )); This yields seconds(0) , due to the gross truncation error which the check was designed to prevent in the first place.

If that sounds obscure, it is: ordering units inside packs is a deep library implementation detail, and we try to avoid letting end users encounter this. To reach this error, you need two distinct units that have the same Dimension, Magnitude, and Origin. That\u2019s a necessary but not sufficient condition: for example, even UnitInverseT<Seconds> and Hertz won\u2019t trigger this! More background info on why this error exists In case you want to understand more, here is the gist. Au is heavily based on parameter packs. Some of these packs, such as UnitProduct<...> and CommonUnit<...> , take units as their arguments. TODO Make a doc page for parameter packs, and link to it here. Every parameter pack needs an unambiguous canonical ordering for any possible set of input arguments. Therefore, we need to create a strict total ordering for the (infinitely many!) unit types that could appear in these packs. This ordering needs to be known at compile time . The ordering itself doesn\u2019t matter so much, but if we don\u2019t strictly adhere to some ordering, it\u2019s undefined behaviour. Our strategy is to construct a \u201cgauntlet\u201d of properties which we can measure for any unit (e.g., Dimension, Magnitude, \u2026), and define some arbitrary ordering for each property. We then compare the units on each property in turn. The first one where they differ \u201cwins\u201d. If we get through all the properties, and they\u2019re still tied, then we have two distinct unit types which compare as equal. This would be undefined behaviour! Rather than silently ignoring this, we manifest this as a compiler error. That is what \u201cbroken strict total ordering\u201d means. Solution: If you have two distinct units, and the library can\u2019t figure out how to order them, you can force a particular ordering. Choose one of the units and give it a high \u201cunit avoidance\u201d score (see example below). This will break the tie. Again, this is pretty unusual. For most normal ways of forming units, the library should automatically be able to define an ordering for them. If you do hit this error, it may be worth pausing to double-check that you\u2019re using the library correctly. Tip If you hit this error, you might be annoyed by its obscurity. Instead, try feeling relieved! After all, the alternative is not \u201ccorrectly working program\u201d, but \u201csilent undefined behaviour\u201d. A compiler error with a searchable error message is infinitely preferable to the latter. Example Code Note that this example is somewhat convoluted, but again, that\u2019s to be expected because this error is pretty hard to hit in practice.

Au goes further, and makes this constructor private. The reason is to preserve unit safety at all callsites. We can\u2019t know whether you made an alias that doesn\u2019t name the unit. For example, if you want everybody to measure lengths in Meters in your codebase, you might provide a common alias like this: using Length = QuantityD < Meters > ; If you did, then end users could write the following: constexpr Length MAX_LENGTH { 5.5 }; // Unsafe! Units unclear. :( A core principle of the Au library is that the only way to enter or exit the library boundaries is to name the unit of measure, explicitly, at the callsite, like this: constexpr Length MAX_LENGTH = meters ( 5.5 ); // Usable! Units unambiguous. :) This enables users who want to use this kind of \u201cdimension-named alias\u201d in their codebase to do so safely.

There are two main sources for this risk, both having to do with integral storage types. Inexact conversion . Example: inches(24).as(feet) . Overflow . Example: giga(hertz)(1).as(hertz) . Both of these examples would in fact produce the correct answer with the specific values given ( 24 and 1 ). However, many (most!) other values would not. Thus, we disallow the entire conversion operation (at least in this format). Solution: There are different strategies to solve this, depending on your use case. Use floating point . As mentioned above, these risks only apply to integer values. If floating point is what you want anyway, just use it. giga(hertz)(1.0).as(hertz) produces hertz(1'000'000'000.0) . Use \u201cexplicit Rep\u201d form . The \u201cRep\u201d is the storage type for the Quantity.

If that sounds obscure, it is: ordering units inside packs is a deep library implementation detail, and we try to avoid letting end users encounter this. To reach this error, you need two distinct units that have the same Dimension, Magnitude, and Origin. That\u2019s a necessary but not sufficient condition: for example, even UnitInverseT<Seconds> and Hertz won\u2019t trigger this! More background info on why this error exists In case you want to understand more, here is the gist. Au is heavily based on parameter packs. Some of these packs, such as UnitProduct<...> and CommonUnit<...> , take units as their arguments. TODO Make a doc page for parameter packs, and link to it here. Every parameter pack needs an unambiguous canonical ordering for any possible set of input arguments. Therefore, we need to create a strict total ordering for the (infinitely many!) unit types that could appear in these packs. This ordering needs to be known at compile time . The ordering itself doesn\u2019t matter so much, but if we don\u2019t strictly adhere to some ordering, it\u2019s undefined behaviour. Our strategy is to construct a \u201cgauntlet\u201d of properties which we can measure for any unit (e.g., Dimension, Magnitude, \u2026), and define some arbitrary ordering for each property. We then compare the units on each property in turn. The first one where they differ \u201cwins\u201d. If we get through all the properties, and they\u2019re still tied, then we have two distinct unit types which compare as equal. This would be undefined behaviour! Rather than silently ignoring this, we manifest this as a compiler error. That is what \u201cbroken strict total ordering\u201d means. Solution: If you have two distinct units, and the library can\u2019t figure out how to order them, you can force a particular ordering. Choose one of the units and give it a high \u201cunit avoidance\u201d score (see example below). This will break the tie. Again, this is pretty unusual. For most normal ways of forming units, the library should automatically be able to define an ordering for them. If you do hit this error, it may be worth pausing to double-check that you\u2019re using the library correctly. Tip If you hit this error, you might be annoyed by its obscurity. Instead, try feeling relieved! After all, the alternative is not \u201ccorrectly working program\u201d, but \u201csilent undefined behaviour\u201d. A compiler error with a searchable error message is infinitely preferable to the latter.

However, the tradeoffs required to use these libraries can be so significant that many people can\u2019t or won\u2019t use them. For example: the compiler errors may be inscrutable or overwhelming; the compilation process may become unacceptably slow; or, the required C++ standard may simply be too new for a user. Au is an accessible, production-tested alternative. We provide a number of rare or outright novel features, with a small compile time footprint \u2014 and we\u2019re compatible with every C++ version back to the mature and widely available C++14 standard. Key features include: Fully unit-safe APIs, on both entry and exit. The \u201csafety surface\u201d: conversions that adapt to the overflow risk based on both conversion magnitude, and storage type. Highly composable \u201cquantity maker\u201d APIs make it easy to both compose new units, and apply unit prefixes, on the fly. Human-readable and concise compiler errors, via strong typenames for units. The Zero type: novel, fluent handling of construction, comparison, and sign handling for quantities. Ease of migration (both to and from Au): with minimal setup, we support bidirectional implicit conversions with equivalent types from any other units library. Support for single-header-file delivery, but with easy customization of units and features to include. Proven track record supporting embedded applications as first class citizens, via such features as our safe handling of integer Rep, treating all Reps on equal footing, and our easy ability to exclude expensive <iostream> support. Intelligent, unit-aware functions for rounding and computing inverses. Minimal friction by using a single, short namespace: everything\u2019s in au:: . Detailed comparison matrices \u00b6 Here\u2019s a more detailed comparison to the most prominent alternatives. We\u2019ll use the following legend 1 : td.na::before { content: \"(Not assessed)\"; } th.highlight { background-color: #ccc; } span.criterion { font-weight: bold; } .md-typeset details.criterion summary { padding-left: 0.5rem; } li.check, li.x { list-style: none; margin-left: 0; text-indent: -2ch; } li.check:before { content: \"\\2713 \"; } li.x:before { content: \"\\2717 \"; } details.criterion > summary::before { display: none; } Legend Lacks feature / poor support Fair / basic support Good / solid support Best support (of libraries considered here) Obtaining the library \u00b6 These are the first criteria to consider. They will tell you whether you can even use the library at all, and if so, how hard it will be to obtain. Boost nholthaus mp-units Au C++ Version Compatibility The minimum C++ standard required to use the library. C++98 or C++03 (unclear which, but best in either case) C++14 C++20 C++14 Ease of Acquisition Ease of including this library in projects using a wide variety of build environments Part of boost Single, self-contained header First class conan support; available on vcpkg Supports single-header delivery, with features: Easy to customize units and I/O support Version-stamped for full reproducibility Note These ratings are written with all users and projects in mind. Keep in mind that what matters for you is your project. For example: mp-units gets low accessibility ratings because of its steep C++20 minimum requirement, and its dependence on a package manager to make the installation easy. However, if your project is already compatible with C++20, and already uses conan, then these \u201clow\u201d ratings would be completely irrelevant for you. Generic developer experience \u00b6 Next: how will this library change the generic developer experience? Leaving aside any library features, conventions, or implementation strategies, there are two main impacts to developer experience. Your program will take longer to compile , because the compiler is doing more work to produce essentially the same program. You will get more compiler errors that developers will need to understand and fix. These costs can bring significant benefits, but we still want them to be as small as possible. Boost nholthaus mp-units Au Compilation Speed The extra time the library adds to compiling a translation unit, compared to no units library. Poor: typically adds several seconds per translation unit Fair: enough that end users tend to notice Good: not \"subjectively noticeable\" Very slow, but can be greatly improved by removing I/O support and most units Possibly \"best\", but will need to assess all libraries on the same code Compiler Error Readability The ability to understand errors when the library catches a mistake it was designed to catch. Poor: Excessively long, nested types Fair: Short, but dimension names lacking Good: Brief typenames with user-facing unit names Infamously challenging Positional dimensions Pioneered strong typedefs for units No dimension in type name leads to shorter types Detailed troubleshooting guide Library features \u00b6 At this point, you\u2019ve assessed: whether you can use each library at all; how hard it will be to add to your project; and, what costs you\u2019ll pay in developer experience if you do. Now we\u2019re ready to compare the libraries \u201cas units libraries\u201d \u2014 that is, in terms of their core features. Boost nholthaus mp-units Au Conversion Safety Guarding against unit conversions that are likely to produce large errors. (For example: we can convert an integer number of feet to inches, but not vice versa.) Integer Reps unsafe Policy consistent with std::chrono library Automatically adapts to level of overflow risk Unit Safety The ability to judge the unit-correctness of every individual line of code by inspection, in isolation. Fair: can achieve indirectly, by casting to known type before retrieving value. Good: provide unit-safe interfaces. Only contains unit-safe interfaces Low Friction How easy it is to develop with the library. Criteria include: Headers: few, or easily guessable Simple namespace structure Reasonable, safe implicit conversions Single file is very easy User-friendly API typenames ( meter_t , ...) Namespaces add verbosity, and friction (for example, math:: namespace prevents ADL ) Namespaces: just one, and it's short Includes: either single-header, or easily-guessable header per unit Composability The ability to fluently combine the abstractions for units and prefixes to form new units on the fly. Prefix only No Quantity References compose; prefixes don't QuantityMaker and PrefixApplier APIs Mixed-Rep Support The ease of freely mixing different storage types (\"Reps\") in the same program. Possible, but user-facing types use a global \"preferred\" Rep. Generic Dimensions The ability to write (template) functions that operate on any dimensionally consistent inputs. (For example, a function that takes any length and time quantities, and returns the appropriate speed quantity.) Generic templates, constrained with traits Generic templates, constrained with traits Concepts excel here Currently clunky. Could be better by adding concepts in extra C++20-only file, without compromising C++14 support. Extensibility How easy it is to add new units, dimensions, or systems. Can add new units and dimensions One-line macro defines new units Can't add dimensions Can even handle, e.g., systems of \"natural\" units Can add new units and dimensions Ease of Migration Support for two migration use cases: From \"no units\" to this library Between this library and another units library (either direction) No interop with other units libraries No interop with other units libraries quantity_like_traits \"Equivalent types\" feature gives more API compatibility Point Types Support for \"point-like\" quantities, also known as \"affine space types\" . absolute wrapper for unit Optional \"offset\" for units, but can't distinguish quantity from point . Magnitudes The features of the representation for different units' sizes. Key features include: Irrational numbers (such as \\(\\pi\\)) Powers (robust against overflow) Roots (exact representations) Close: lacks only irrationals, basis, and instance arithmetic. Ahead of its time! Uses ratio plus \"pi powers\": good angle handling, but vulnerable to overflow Full support for Magnitudes Formerly, Au alone was best, but we shared Magnitudes with mp-units Embedded Friendliness Support common embedded use cases. Key examples include: Flexibility in the Rep (usually a variety of integral types, and perhaps float , but rarely double ). The easy ability to exclude <iostreams> . Assumed to be good, based on mixed-Rep support Can trim by excluding <iostream> , but integer-Rep support is poor. Assumed to be good, based on mixed-Rep support Best choice of all: No \"preferred\" Rep. Safe integer operations. User-defined literals (UDLs) Concise expressions such as `3_m` for \"3 meters\", or some comparable alternative. Flexibility in the Rep (usually a variety of integral types, and perhaps float , but rarely double ). The easy ability to exclude <iostreams> . UDLs UDLs and Quantity References Planned to add: #43 Rep Variety The range of different storage types (\"Reps\") permitted. Poor: only 1 or 2 types Fair: all built-in numeric types Good: also support custom numeric types Supports custom numeric types Effectively floating-point only (integer types unsafe ) Well defined Representation concept Rep can only be is_arithmetic for now, but plan to upgrade Zero Quantity support for constructing from, and comparing with, 0 : the only number which is meaningful for every unit. (Includes facilities for working with quantity signs.) Guidance: use default constructor to construct, but no special facility for comparison Supports copysign() , but no special construction or comparison Has q::zero() member, but no special construction or comparison Can use ZERO to construct or compare any quantity Angles First-class support for angular quantities, including degrees and radians. Curiously imprecise pi value Non-linear scales (such as dB) Support for logarithmic \"units\", such as decibels or nepers Plan to support someday; see #41 . \"Kind\" Types Support for distinguishing different \"kinds\" of the same dimension, such as a length from a width. No plans to support. Explicit Systems of Measurement Support for different systems, each with their own (possibly incompatible) collection of dimensions. Single, implicit global system Single, implicit global system. (Intentional design tradeoff: reduces learning curve, and makes compiler errors shorter.) Units as types Types that represent abstract units (clearly distinct from quantities of that unit). Types exist, but conflated with quantity names Can form instances and do arithmetic Macro Usage Avoidance of macros, especially in user-facing code. Present in user-facing APIs Present in user-facing APIs Confined to outer compatibility layer No macros Users may have expected a \u201ctraffic light\u201d style, green/yellow/red color scheme.

Boost nholthaus mp-units Au Conversion Safety Guarding against unit conversions that are likely to produce large errors. (For example: we can convert an integer number of feet to inches, but not vice versa.) Integer Reps unsafe Policy consistent with std::chrono library Automatically adapts to level of overflow risk Unit Safety The ability to judge the unit-correctness of every individual line of code by inspection, in isolation. Fair: can achieve indirectly, by casting to known type before retrieving value. Good: provide unit-safe interfaces. Only contains unit-safe interfaces Low Friction How easy it is to develop with the library. Criteria include: Headers: few, or easily guessable Simple namespace structure Reasonable, safe implicit conversions Single file is very easy User-friendly API typenames ( meter_t , ...) Namespaces add verbosity, and friction (for example, math:: namespace prevents ADL ) Namespaces: just one, and it's short Includes: either single-header, or easily-guessable header per unit Composability The ability to fluently combine the abstractions for units and prefixes to form new units on the fly. Prefix only No Quantity References compose; prefixes don't QuantityMaker and PrefixApplier APIs Mixed-Rep Support The ease of freely mixing different storage types (\"Reps\") in the same program. Possible, but user-facing types use a global \"preferred\" Rep. Generic Dimensions The ability to write (template) functions that operate on any dimensionally consistent inputs. (For example, a function that takes any length and time quantities, and returns the appropriate speed quantity.) Generic templates, constrained with traits Generic templates, constrained with traits Concepts excel here Currently clunky. Could be better by adding concepts in extra C++20-only file, without compromising C++14 support. Extensibility How easy it is to add new units, dimensions, or systems. Can add new units and dimensions One-line macro defines new units Can't add dimensions Can even handle, e.g., systems of \"natural\" units Can add new units and dimensions Ease of Migration Support for two migration use cases: From \"no units\" to this library Between this library and another units library (either direction) No interop with other units libraries No interop with other units libraries quantity_like_traits \"Equivalent types\" feature gives more API compatibility Point Types Support for \"point-like\" quantities, also known as \"affine space types\" . absolute wrapper for unit Optional \"offset\" for units, but can't distinguish quantity from point . Magnitudes The features of the representation for different units' sizes. Key features include: Irrational numbers (such as \\(\\pi\\)) Powers (robust against overflow) Roots (exact representations) Close: lacks only irrationals, basis, and instance arithmetic. Ahead of its time! Uses ratio plus \"pi powers\": good angle handling, but vulnerable to overflow Full support for Magnitudes Formerly, Au alone was best, but we shared Magnitudes with mp-units Embedded Friendliness Support common embedded use cases.

Assumed to be good, based on mixed-Rep support Can trim by excluding <iostream> , but integer-Rep support is poor. Assumed to be good, based on mixed-Rep support Best choice of all: No \"preferred\" Rep. Safe integer operations.

(Includes facilities for working with quantity signs.) Guidance: use default constructor to construct, but no special facility for comparison Supports copysign() , but no special construction or comparison Has q::zero() member, but no special construction or comparison Can use ZERO to construct or compare any quantity Angles First-class support for angular quantities, including degrees and radians. Curiously imprecise pi value Non-linear scales (such as dB) Support for logarithmic \"units\", such as decibels or nepers Plan to support someday; see #41 . \"Kind\" Types Support for distinguishing different \"kinds\" of the same dimension, such as a length from a width.

Tip If it\u2019s a common unit\u2014one which should be in the library, but isn\u2019t \u2014go ahead and file an issue ! We should be able to turn it around pretty quickly (either adding it to the library, or explaining why we won\u2019t). Definition features \u00b6 Many libraries provide \u201cconvenience\u201d macros for creating new units, but ours tries to avoid macros completely. 1 Instead, you define new units by just writing regular C++ code. There are several pieces you can add, each of which provides some particular feature. Here is a complete sample definition of a new Unit, with these features annotated and explained. C++14 C++17 or later // Example custom unit definition below. // // Items labeled with `*` are _required_; everything else is optional. // In .hh file: struct Fathoms : decltype ( Inches {} * mag < 72 > ()) { // *[1] static constexpr const char label [] = \"ftm\" ; // [2a] }; constexpr auto fathom = SingularNameFor < Fathoms > {}; // [3] constexpr auto fathoms = QuantityMaker < Fathoms > {}; // *[4] constexpr auto fathoms_pt = QuantityPointMaker < Fathoms > {}; // [5; less common] // In .cc file: constexpr const char Fathoms :: label []; // [2b] // Example custom unit definition below. // // Items labeled with `*` are _required_; everything else is optional. // In .hh file: struct Fathoms : decltype ( Inches {} * mag < 72 > ()) { // *[1] static constexpr inline const char label [] = \"ftm\" ; // [2] }; constexpr auto fathom = SingularNameFor < Fathoms > {}; // [3] constexpr auto fathoms = QuantityMaker < Fathoms > {}; // *[4] constexpr auto fathoms_pt = QuantityPointMaker < Fathoms > {}; // [5; less common] Note If you\u2019ve seen the unit definitions included in our library, you may notice they look a little different from the above. That\u2019s because the library has different goals and constraints than end user projects have. For example, the library needs to be both C++14-compatible and header-only. This forces us to define our labels in a more complicated way. By contrast, your project is unlikely to have both these constraints. Prefer the simpler approach outlined in this page, instead of treating our library\u2019s source code definitions as examples to follow. Here are the features. Strong type definition . Required. Make a struct with the name you want, and inherit from decltype(u) , where u is some unit expression which gives it the right Dimension and Magnitude. (We\u2019ll explain unit expressions in the next section.) Label . A sizeof() -compatible label which is useful for printing the Unit. Note that if your project needs C++14 compatibility, then besides the label itself ( [2a] ), you\u2019ll need to provide a definition ( [2b] ) in the .cc file. By contrast, if you use C++17 or later, you can just use an inline variable, and you won\u2019t need a .cc file. If omitted: Everything will still work ; your Quantity will just be labeled as [UNLABELED UNIT] in printing contexts. Singular name . An object whose name is the singular name for your unit. Useful in certain contexts: for example, the traditional unit for torque is \u201c newton meters\u201d, not \u201c newtons meters\u201d. If omitted: you\u2019ll sacrifice some readability flow: the grammar becomes strange. You\u2019ll end up with constructs like speed.in(miles / hours) , rather than speed.in(miles / hour) . 2 Quantity maker . Required. This gives you a snake_case version of your unit which acts like a function. If you call this \u201cfunction\u201d and pass it any numeric type, it creates a Quantity of your unit , whose Rep is that type. Of course, a quantity maker is much more than a function: it composes nicely with prefixes, and with other quantity makers. Quantity point maker . Just like the quantity maker, but conventionally with a _pt suffix to indicate that it makes QuantityPoint instead. You can call this like a function on arbitrary numeric types. You can also compose it with prefixes, or scale it with Magnitudes. If omitted: this is usually fine to omit: most Units are only used with Quantity , not QuantityPoint . Note Not shown here: adding an origin member. We skipped this because it is very rare. It only has any effect at all for Units you plan to use with QuantityPoint , which is not the usual case. Even among those units, only a small subset have a non-default origin. The main examples are Celsius and Fahrenheit , and the library will provide those out of the box. Unit expressions \u00b6 Above, we said to inherit your unit\u2019s strong type from the decltype of a \u201cunit expression\u201d. Recall the line from above: struct Fathoms : decltype ( Inches {} * mag < 72 > ()) { // Unit Expression ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This section explains what kinds of things can go inside of the decltype(...) . Conceptually, units are defined by combining other units . In general, given any set of units, you can multiply them, divide them, raise them to powers, or scale them by real numbers (\u201cmagnitudes\u201d): the result of any of these operations defines a new unit. In C++ code, the easiest way to do this is by working with instances of the unit types. ( Meters is the type ; Meters{} is an instance of the type.) This lets us multiply them naturally by writing * , rather than using cumbersome template traits such as UnitProductT<...> . Here are some examples: Newtons: Kilo<Grams>{} * Meters{} / squared(Seconds{}) Miles: Feet{} * mag<5280>() Degrees: Radians{} * PI / mag<180>() Aliases vs. strong types: best practices \u00b6 A shorter method of defining units is as aliases for a compound unit. For example: using MilesPerHour = decltype ( Miles {} / Hours {}); constexpr auto miles_per_hour = miles / hour ; We can use the alias, MilesPerHour , anywhere we\u2019d use a unit type. And we can call the QuantityMaker, miles_per_hour , just as we would call miles . 3 We even get an automatically generated unit label: mi / h . Despite this convenience, aliases aren\u2019t always the best choice. Here\u2019s the best practices guidance to follow. Use strong types for named units. Example: Newtons ; Fathoms Rationale: Strong types show up in compiler errors, making them easier to read. Counterpoint: as seen below, this will reduce the ability to cancel out units. For example, Meters{} * Hertz{} will not be the same as Meters{} / Seconds{} ; instead, it will be a different-but-equivalent Unit. Given the way we handle quantity-equivalent Units, this will usually not be a problem, and we believe the value of seeing shorter, more familiar names in the compiler errors outweighs this cost. Use aliases for compound units with no special name. Example: NewtonMeters ; MilesPerHour . Both of these are better implemented as aliases rather than strong types . Rationale: Keeping these as aliases increases support for cancellation: it enables the library to notice that MetersPerSecond{} * Seconds{} is identical to Meters{} , not merely quantity-equivalent. This doesn\u2019t usually matter, but it can reduce exposure to compiler errors in the (rare) situations where exact-type-equality matters (e.g., initializer lists). Macros have long been considered contrary to C++ best practices. If we\u2019re going to use one, especially in user-facing code, it needs to meet a very high bar. Unit definition macros don\u2019t meet this bar. They mostly exist to save typing. But code is read far more often than written, and macros actually make the definitions harder to read and understand (because they use positional arguments, so the meaning of the parameters is unclear at the callsite). \u21a9 Note that this requires us to build out multiplication and division between two QuantityMaker instances, rather than just a QuantityMaker and a SingularNameFor . We haven\u2019t done this yet, but it\u2019s inevitable that we will, to support composing units whose singular name is identical to the plural name (e.g., hertz ). \u21a9 Note that we don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d to define this. We could write (miles / hour)(65) , and get exactly the same result as miles_per_hour(65) .

Time: TBD. Prerequisites: Experience writing C++ code. You will learn: The concept and importance of \u201cunit safety\u201d. How to store a numeric value in a quantity . How to retrieve the stored numeric value. Some basic operations you can perform with a quantity. Status quo: no units library \u00b6 Suppose you have a variable that represents a physical quantity . That variable has some value , but that value is meaningless unless you also know the unit of measurement . We usually indicate the unit with a suffix on the variable name. Here\u2019s a concrete example: const double track_length_m = 100.0 ; // Unit suffix--^^ ^^^^^--Value const double best_time_s = 10.34 ; // Unit suffix--^^ ^^^^^--Value The first value is 100.0 . Since there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201clength of 100\u201d, we add a _m suffix on the end of our variable name to make it clear that the value is the length in meters . We take a similar approach for our time in seconds . This strategy works , in the sense that it can prevent unit errors, but it\u2019s labor intensive and error prone. The naming suffixes provide hints, but enforcement is basically on the honor system. Consider a function we might want to call: double average_speed_mps ( double length_m , double time_s ); With the above variables, our callsite might look like this: const auto speed_mps = average_speed_mps ( track_length_m , best_time_s ); It\u2019s time to consider a very important property: Definition Unit correctness: a program is unit-correct when every variable associated with physical units is used consistently with those units. So: is this unit-correct? Yes: track_length_m gets passed as the parameter length_m : meters to meters best_time_s gets passed as the parameter time_s : seconds to seconds However, it\u2019s quite fragile. We could just as easily have written the following. const auto speed_mps = average_speed_mps ( best_time_s , track_length_m ); By itself, this line looks correct: we\u2019re asking for an average speed, given a time and a length. We can even see that we\u2019re passing in values in seconds and meters to get a result in meters-per-second, increasing our confidence! Of course, the line is wrong, but the only way to know that it\u2019s wrong is to go read the declaration of average_speed_mps . This could easily be in some other file. In a big project, it might be hard to even figure out which file it\u2019s in. That\u2019s a lot of cognitive load! Our goal: unit safety \u00b6 To write code quickly and robustly, unit-correctness is not enough . We need more: we need unit safety . Definition Unit safety : We call a program unit-safe when the unit-correctness of each line of code can be checked by inspection , in isolation . This is the way to reduce cognitive load for code readers, when it comes to physical units. If you inspect a unit-safe line, and see that it\u2019s correct, then you\u2019re done with that line. You can move on; you don\u2019t have to hold it in your head. Tip A unit-safe line doesn\u2019t guarantee that the program has no unit errors. It does guarantee that if there are unit errors, then they\u2019re in some other line (which you can also inspect!). Unit-safety is not something you could ever get from the standard numeric types, but you can get it from the Au library. Let\u2019s learn how! Storing values: the \u201cquantity maker\u201d \u00b6 The way to achieve unit-safety is by turning our raw numeric values into quantities . We do this with quantity makers . These are callables\u2014things that act like functions\u2014which have the name of some unit , and accept any numeric type . For example, let\u2019s make our variable track_length_m unit-safe by using the quantity maker, meters : const auto track_length = meters ( track_length_m ); // ^^^^^^ ^^ // Quantity maker of *meters* Takes value in *meters* This is an example of a unit-safe handoff . We take a raw number whose name tells us it was in meters, and we pass it to the quantity maker for that same unit . We can see this line is unit-correct simply by inspection\u2014our first example of a unit-safe line. In fact, we have already achieved unit safety everywhere we use the quantity track_length instead of the raw number track_length_m ! Think of the quantity as a container , which holds its value securely together with information about its unit. We\u2019ll see that the quantity prevents us from using that value in ways that are incompatible with its unit. Retrieving values: you must name the unit \u00b6 Ideally, every interface that takes physical quantities would use unit-safe quantity types . In practice, you can\u2019t upgrade your entire codebase at once. Even if you could, there will always be third-party libraries which don\u2019t know about these quantity types. One way or another, it\u2019s important to be able to get the value out. Let\u2019s imagine we have this example third-party API, which needs a raw double . How can we call it if we have a quantity? // Example third-party API. class Racetrack ; class RacetrackBuilder { public : // Main function we'll call: void set_length_m ( double length_m ); Racetrack build_track (); }; Most units libraries provide a function that retrieves a quantity\u2019s value \u201cin whatever units it happens to be stored\u201d. (Think of std::chrono::duration::count() as a very common example.) These kinds of functions may be convenient, but they\u2019re not unit-safe. 1 Au takes a different approach. To retrieve the value from a quantity q , you call q.in(units) , where units is the quantity maker you used to store the value. Continuing with our earlier example, we could call that API like so: RacetrackBuilder builder ; builder . set_length_m ( track_length . in ( meters )); // ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^ // API wants length in *meters* Get value in *meters* Here, we have another unit-safe handoff . Our first one showed how we enter the library by naming the unit. This one shows how we exit the library by naming that same unit. Tip Think of the quantity maker\u2019s name as a kind of \u201cpassword\u201d which you set when you create the quantity. The quantity will hold its underlying value securely. To retrieve that value, you must speak the same \u201cpassword\u201d (that is, name the same unit). Of course, this API is a best-case scenario for raw numeric APIs, since it names the units at the callsite (via the _m suffix on set_length_m() ). Our other API, average_speed_mps() , can\u2019t do this, because we can\u2019t see the parameter names at the callsite. In fact, although we\u2019ll see some coping strategies in later lessons, there is no unit-safe way to call average_speed_mps() directly . Basic quantity operations \u00b6 Quantity types do much more than simply hold their values securely: they support a variety of operations. In fact, we strive to support every meaningful operation, because operation implementations for quantity types can faithfully maintain unit safety. Tip Treat any instance of retrieving the value as \u201ccode smell\u201d. Stop and check whether there\u2019s some way to perform the operation within the quantity type. If there\u2019s not, stop and consider whether there should be. By \u201ccode smell\u201d, we don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s definitely wrong; in fact, it\u2019s often necessary. We just mean it\u2019s worth checking to see if there\u2019s a better pattern. The first and most basic operations which we\u2019ll cover here are arithmetic operations. You can add, subtract, and compare quantities of the same units. 2 You can multiply and divide quantities of any units. Example: same-unit operations Here are a couple examples of operations among quantities with the same unit . constexpr auto distance = meters ( 1.0 ) + meters ( 2.0 ); // distance -> meters(3.0) constexpr auto is_duration_greater = ( seconds ( 60 ) > seconds ( 55 )); // is_duration_greater -> true Admittedly, these examples are very basic for now. Future lessons will explore more interesting examples\u2014like, what happens when you compare a length in inches, to a length in centimeters? But for now, the takeaway is simply that we neither need nor want to extract underlying values to perform basic operations. Multiplying and dividing quantities \u00b6 The product of two quantities is another quantity. Recall that a quantity variable has two parts: the unit , and the value . These parts compose nicely with multiplication. The unit of the product is the product of the units. The value of the product is the product of the values. All of these same considerations apply to division. So for example: (meters / second) is a quantity maker. You can call it and pass any numerical type, just as with the quantity makers meters or seconds . In particular, meters ( 50.0 ) / seconds ( 10.0 ) == ( meters / second )( 5.0 ); Tip To form a compound quantity maker, use the grammatically correct name of the unit. Examples: meters / second , not meters / seconds newton * meters , not newtons * meters Empirically, we have found that this pattern works: (s * ...) * p / (s * ...) . That is: pluralize only one token for singular tokens: put those which multiply on the left , and those which divide on the right . Exercise: computing with quantities \u00b6 To get some practice with quantities, we\u2019ve included an exercise where you can make and print some quantities, and then upgrade an existing function implementation from raw numbers to quantities. Check out the Au 101: API Types Exercise ! Takeaways \u00b6 We strive for unit safety . If we can check the unit-correctness of every individual line of code, by inspection, in isolation, we can reduce cognitive load, and write code faster and more robustly. To store a raw numeric value safely inside of a quantity object, call the quantity maker whose name is the unit of interest. For example, meters(3) is quantity representing 3\\,\\text{m} 3\\,\\text{m} , stored as int . To retrieve a stored numeric value from a quantity q , call q.in(units) , where units was the quantity maker used in the first place. For example, meters(3).in(meters) is simply 3 . Quantity makers compose : you can multiply, divide, and raise them to powers to get a new quantity maker. For example, (meters / second) is a quantity maker which you can call like any other. (meters / second)(5) represents the quantity 5\\,\\text{m/s} 5\\,\\text{m/s} . Tip Au only contains unit-safe interfaces. That\u2019s why simply storing the value in a quantity is enough to achieve unit-safety! To take the example from std::chrono::duration , note that the system clock has different resolutions on different widely used toolchains . gcc uses 1\\,\\text{ns} 1\\,\\text{ns} , MSVC uses 100\\,\\text{ns} 100\\,\\text{ns} , and clang uses 1000\\,\\text{ns} 1000\\,\\text{ns} . So if you subtracted two calls to std::chrono::system_clock::now() and called .count() , your answers would vary by 3 orders of magnitude on different compilers! This is not to say that doing so would be a good use of the chrono library. It\u2019s not, and that\u2019s the point: a bare call to .count() gives the reader no idea how to interpret its result. \u21a9 What about adding, subtracting, and comparing quantities of different units, but the same dimensions\u2014like comparing seconds(100) to minutes(1) , or adding inches(1) to feet(6) ? In most cases, we do support this as well, but it\u2019s a more advanced usage which we\u2019ll discuss further in future lessons. \u21a9","title":"Au 101: Quantity Makers"},{"location":"tutorial/101-quantity-makers/#au-101-quantity-makers","text":"This tutorial gives a gentle introduction to the Au library.

That variable has some value , but that value is meaningless unless you also know the unit of measurement . We usually indicate the unit with a suffix on the variable name. Here\u2019s a concrete example: const double track_length_m = 100.0 ; // Unit suffix--^^ ^^^^^--Value const double best_time_s = 10.34 ; // Unit suffix--^^ ^^^^^--Value The first value is 100.0 . Since there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201clength of 100\u201d, we add a _m suffix on the end of our variable name to make it clear that the value is the length in meters . We take a similar approach for our time in seconds . This strategy works , in the sense that it can prevent unit errors, but it\u2019s labor intensive and error prone. The naming suffixes provide hints, but enforcement is basically on the honor system. Consider a function we might want to call: double average_speed_mps ( double length_m , double time_s ); With the above variables, our callsite might look like this: const auto speed_mps = average_speed_mps ( track_length_m , best_time_s ); It\u2019s time to consider a very important property: Definition Unit correctness: a program is unit-correct when every variable associated with physical units is used consistently with those units. So: is this unit-correct? Yes: track_length_m gets passed as the parameter length_m : meters to meters best_time_s gets passed as the parameter time_s : seconds to seconds However, it\u2019s quite fragile. We could just as easily have written the following. const auto speed_mps = average_speed_mps ( best_time_s , track_length_m ); By itself, this line looks correct: we\u2019re asking for an average speed, given a time and a length. We can even see that we\u2019re passing in values in seconds and meters to get a result in meters-per-second, increasing our confidence! Of course, the line is wrong, but the only way to know that it\u2019s wrong is to go read the declaration of average_speed_mps . This could easily be in some other file.

One way or another, it\u2019s important to be able to get the value out. Let\u2019s imagine we have this example third-party API, which needs a raw double . How can we call it if we have a quantity? // Example third-party API. class Racetrack ; class RacetrackBuilder { public : // Main function we'll call: void set_length_m ( double length_m ); Racetrack build_track (); }; Most units libraries provide a function that retrieves a quantity\u2019s value \u201cin whatever units it happens to be stored\u201d. (Think of std::chrono::duration::count() as a very common example.) These kinds of functions may be convenient, but they\u2019re not unit-safe. 1 Au takes a different approach.

You can form compound units by simply performing arithmetic on instances of the unit types, and defining an alias. For example, decltype(Meters{} / squared(Seconds{})) is a unit type , representing the unit \\text{m} / \\text{s}^2 \\text{m} / \\text{s}^2 . While we avoid using macros in our own library, we can\u2019t avoid them in others! Even within this repository, we use googletest for our test cases, and googletest is macro-based. \u21a9","title":"Takeaways"},{"location":"tutorial/exercise/101-quantity-makers/","text":"Au 101: Quantity Makers Exercise \u00b6 Note This is the exercise for the concepts in the tutorial page Au 101: Quantity Makers . We\u2019ll assume you\u2019re familiar with everything in that page, so if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll want to read it first. Tip Before you start, make sure you\u2019ve followed the developer\u2019s guide so you\u2019re able to build and test the code! Introduction \u00b6 The point of this exercise is to get some practice making and using quantities. We\u2019ll get values into and out of the units library, and we\u2019ll also perform a few operations (simple arithmetic, and streaming output). The file we\u2019ll be working in can be found here, relative to the repository root: \"tutorial/101_quantity_makers.cc\" The following command executes the code: bazel run //tutorial:101_quantity_makers Run it now to make sure everything\u2019s working: it should run to completion, and all tests should pass. Exercise 1: printing quantities \u00b6 Open up the file, \"tutorial/101_quantity_makers.cc\" , and scroll down to the EXERCISE 1(a) section. This takes you to a function, print_raw_number_and_quantity() , where you\u2019ll begin the exercise. Exercise 1(a) Task Solution and Discussion Read through the function print_raw_number_and_quantity() , and uncomment the final two lines. Note that in the second line, we\u2019re streaming a quantity variable to output. What do you expect to see? When you\u2019ve formed an expectation, run the target: bazel run //tutorial:101_quantity_makers What do you see? Did it match your expectations? Here\u2019s what will be printed: track_length_m: 100 track_length: 100 m Note how the unit information has effectively migrated. With the raw double , it was a suffix on the variable name, which means that human readers are responsible for keeping track of it. With the quantity, it becomes a part of the type itself, so the compiler is responsible for keeping track of it. The Au library has a compile-time label for every unit. When we stream the quantity, we first stream its underlying value, and then stream the unit label. Now we have a more interactive example. We\u2019ll create several quantities, and for each one, you need to write how you expect it to be printed. Exercise 1(b) Task Solution and Discussion Scroll down to the PrintsAsExpected test case (just below the EXERCISE 1(b) comment block), and uncomment each test assertion one at a time. Replace the empty string placeholder, \"\" , with the actual string you expect when streaming this quantity. For example, if you see this: EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string ( squared ( meters )( 100 )), \"\" ); then you would replace it with this: EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string ( squared ( meters )( 100 )), \"100 m^2\" ); When you\u2019re done, your assertions should look something like this: EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string ( meters ( 100 )), \"100 m\" ); EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string ( meters ( 100.0 ) / seconds ( 8.0 )), \"12.5 m / s\" ); EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string (( meters / second )( 12.5 )), \"12.5 m / s\" ); EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string (( meters / second )( 10.0 ) / seconds ( 8.0 )), \"1.25 m / s^2\" ); EXPECT_EQ ( stream_to_string (( meters / second )( 10.0 ) * seconds ( 8.0 )), \"80 m\" ); The first is a warm-up problem: a checkpoint to make sure you\u2019re doing the exercise correctly. The second gives an example of a general principle: when we multiply or divide quantities, we can reason independently about the units, and the underlying values. In this case, we know that the result\u2019s underlying value will be 100.0 / 8.0 , that is, 12.5 . And the unit will be meters ( \\text{m} \\text{m} ) divided by seconds ( \\text{s} \\text{s} ), that is, \\text{m} / \\text{s} \\text{m} / \\text{s} . (Notice how the library automatically generates a label for compound units: from the input labels m and s , the compound label m / s is generated at compile time.) The third example represents the same quantity as the second, except that it\u2019s constructed directly via the compound quantity maker , (meters / second) . Again, as in the tutorial page, note the grammar: we write (meters / second) , not (meters / seconds) . The fourth example shows that when we accumulate powers of the same unit, the automatically generated label knows how to represent these. \u201cMeters per second\u201d, divided by \u201cseconds\u201d, gives \u201cmeters per squared second\u201d, labeled as m / s^2 . The fifth example shows that when any unit cancels out completely, it gets dropped from the label. \u201cMeters per second\u201d, times \u201cseconds\u201d, gives simply \u201cmeters\u201d. Exercise 2: implementing with quantities \u00b6 Exercise 2 Task Solution and Discussion Replace the implementation of the function stopping_accel_mpss() with quantities, instead of raw double s. You will probably want to do this in three stages. Create a new quantity variable for each parameter. It should have the same name, minus the unit suffix. For example, for a parameter double duration_s , you would write: const auto duration = seconds ( duration_s ); (Note the unit-safe handoff, between the quantity-maker seconds and the unit suffix _s .) Replace the raw double s in the core computation with their corresponding quantity variables. Note that you\u2019ll need to change both the type (to auto ), and the name (to eliminate the suffix). Use .in(...) to extract the raw double to return. You\u2019ll need to form the correct quantity maker to pass to it. When you\u2019re done, your implementation should look something like this: // Example updated solution: double stopping_accel_mpss ( double initial_speed_mps , double stopping_distance_m ) { const auto initial_speed = ( meters / second )( initial_speed_mps ); const auto stopping_distance = meters ( stopping_distance_m ); const auto accel = - ( initial_speed * initial_speed ) / ( 2.0 * stopping_distance ); return accel . in ( meters / squared ( second )); } Let\u2019s evaluate the code change relative to the original, which we\u2019ll reproduce here for convenience. // Original: double stopping_accel_mpss ( double initial_speed_mps , double stopping_distance_m ) { const double accel_mpss = - ( initial_speed_mps * initial_speed_mps ) / ( 2.0 * stopping_distance_m ); return accel_mpss ; } PRO: The core computation is now protected from unit errors. The core computation is also less cluttered without the unit suffixes. The runtime performance is identical, with even the slightest optimization levels enabled. CON: We\u2019ve added extra lines to turn our double variables into quantities. We haven\u2019t improved unit safety at the callsites at all. Admittedly, this change is pretty marginal for such a short function, but keep in mind that this example is just a baby step. The real power of the library will come when we learn how to use quantities in our API types : our function parameters, return values, and member variables. Then we\u2019ll gain far-reaching improvements that can make development faster and safer across an entire codebase. Summary \u00b6 This exercise showed the basics of how to work with quantities. Here are some skills we practiced: Turning a raw numeric value into a quantity, by calling a quantity maker (for example, meters(5.0) ). Extracting raw numeric values from quantities, by calling .in(...) (for example, accel.in(meters / squared(second)) ). Forming and using compound quantity makers, such as (meters / second)(12.5) . Performing basic operations with quantities, including: Multiplying and dividing them. Streaming them to output (but see the note below). Note I/O streaming support isn\u2019t included in every installation method . For single-file installations, it\u2019s included by default, but can be omitted by choice. For full library installations, one needs to include \"au/io.hh\" to get this functionality. The gist is that it will tend to be either already included, or easily accessible, unless somebody made a conscious decision during the installation to exclude it.

We\u2019ll assume you\u2019re familiar with everything in that page, so if you\u2019re not, you\u2019ll want to read it first. Tip Before you start, make sure you\u2019ve followed the developer\u2019s guide so you\u2019re able to build and test the code! Introduction: the legacy function \u00b6 Here\u2019s a simple example of a function that deals with physical quantities, but lacks unit safety because it\u2019s using raw numeric types. // The distance (in meters) it would take to stop, with a given starting speed // and constant (negative) acceleration. // // Parameters: // - speed_mps: The starting speed, in meters per second. // - acceleration_mpss: The braking acceleration, in meters per second squared. // // Preconditions: // - speed_mps >= 0.0 // - acceleration_mpss < 0.0 constexpr double stopping_distance_m ( double speed_mps , double acceleration_mpss ); We\u2019re going to provide a unit-safe interface for any clients that want to use it. We\u2019ll leave the old interface in place, so we won\u2019t be forced to update our codebase all at once! To make sure you\u2019re set up and ready to go, run bazel test //tutorial:102_api_types_test . All tests should pass. The three files we\u2019ll be working in can be found here, relative to the repository root: \"tutorial/102_api_types.hh\" \"tutorial/102_api_types.cc\" \"tutorial/102_api_types_test.cc\" Exercise 1: new interface shim \u00b6 Open up the test file, \"tutorial/102_api_types_test.cc\" , and scroll down to the EXERCISE 1 section. You\u2019ll find two test cases below, which are commented out. Uncomment them, and rerun the tests. As before: bazel test //tutorial:102_api_types_test They\u2019ll fail. Exercise 1(a) Task Solution and Discussion Make these new tests compile by declaring a new function, in \"tutorial/102_api_types.hh\" , with this signature: AAA stopping_distance ( BBB speed , CCC acceleration ); The types AAA , BBB , and CCC are placeholders for quantity types; it\u2019s your job to figure out the actual types which should go there. The Rep for each quantity should be double , since that\u2019s what the function we\u2019re replacing uses. As for the Unit , you may find it useful to define appropriate aliases for, say, MetersPerSecond and MetersPerSecondSquared . Something like this inside of your \"tutorial/102_api_types.hh\" file should work: using MetersPerSecond = decltype ( Meters {} / Seconds {}); using MetersPerSecondSquared = decltype ( MetersPerSecond {} / Seconds {}); QuantityD < Meters > stopping_distance ( QuantityD < MetersPerSecond > speed , QuantityD < MetersPerSecondSquared > acceleration ); First, we declared the aliases for the compound units. Then, we made a new signature with quantity types instead of raw double . We used the QuantityD<U> form, rather than Quantity<U, double> , for conciseness. Warning When composing unit type instances (like Meters{} ), we don\u2019t get the same fluency as when we compose quantity makers (like meters ). In particular, we can\u2019t offer the same grammatical fluency. With quantity makers, we would write meters / second . However, with unit type instances, we end up needing to write Meters{} / Seconds{} , rather than Meters{} / Second{} . Note that we also removed the suffixes (such as _m , _mps , and _mpss ) from the variable and function names. Those suffixes were there to help humans keep track of units. Now that\u2019s the compiler\u2019s job! If we rerun the tests now, we\u2019ll find we get a linker error rather than a compiler error. This makes sense: our function hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. Exercise 1(a) Task Solution and Discussion Go to 102_api_types.cc , and implement the function you had just declared. Your function implementation should amount to a thin wrapper on the existing function. First, we\u2019ll \u201cunwrap\u201d the input quantity parameters, giving us raw double values we can pass to the old version. Then, we\u2019ll \u201cwrap\u201d the answer with the appropriate quantity maker. Something like this inside of your \"tutorial/102_api_types.cc\" file should work: QuantityD < Meters > stopping_distance ( QuantityD < MetersPerSecond > speed , QuantityD < MetersPerSecondSquared > acceleration ) { return meters ( stopping_distance_m ( speed . in ( meters / second ), acceleration . in ( meters / squared ( second )))); } Notice how we have a unit-safe handoff on the output. We\u2019re passing the result of stopping_distance_m(...) to meters(...) , and we can see that the units match. We don\u2019t have a unit-safe handoff on the inputs . The only way to check they\u2019re correct is by carefully inspecting the order and comparing to the signature of stopping_distance_m() . Fortunately, that function lives in the same file, so it\u2019s not too onerous to verify the correctness. Reminder about .in(...) syntax The argument you pass needs to be an instance , not a type . It may be tempting to call speed.in(MetersPerSecond) , but that\u2019s not valid C++ (you can\u2019t \u201cpass a type\u201d to a function). That\u2019s why we passed the quantity maker instead: speed.in(meters / second) . Exercise 2: reverse the roles \u00b6 At this point, we\u2019re in pretty decent shape. We\u2019ve provided a unit-safe interface which anyone can take advantage of. And we\u2019ve left the old interface in place, so we haven\u2019t broken any existing clients! However, we can do a lot better. First, if you read the commentary in the previous section\u2019s solution, you\u2019ll know that the input parameters don\u2019t have a unit-safe handoff. That\u2019s a small problem. A bigger problem is that we\u2019re not taking full advantage of the units library in our implementation itself! To see why this matters, introduce a unit error by deleting the * t_s from the end of the implementation: return speed_mps * t_s + 0.5 * acceleration_mpss * t_s * t_s ; // Delete this---^^^^^^ Save the file and rerun all the tests. Even though the implementation is wrong, the tests all pass! Note that we\u2019re adding a distance and a speed here. If we were using quantities , the wrong code wouldn\u2019t even compile . (That said: in a real project, this would also be a good signal to add more test cases, too. ) Undo the error you introduced. Now you\u2019re ready to fix both these problems at once. Exercise 2 Task Solution and Discussion Reverse the roles of the functions. Use quantity types for the core logic . Turn the raw numeric version into the thin wrapper . All existing tests should pass without modification. Something like this inside of your \"tutorial/102_api_types.cc\" file should work: double stopping_distance_m ( double speed_mps , double acceleration_mpss ) { // Convenient ad hoc quantity makers, for readability. constexpr auto mps = meters / second ; constexpr auto mpss = meters / squared ( second ); return stopping_distance ( mps ( speed_mps ), mpss ( acceleration_mpss )). in ( meters ); } QuantityD < Meters > stopping_distance ( QuantityD < MetersPerSecond > speed , QuantityD < MetersPerSecondSquared > acceleration ) { // This first implementation uses only the most basic kinematic equations. // We could refactor it later to be more efficient. // t = (v - v0) / a const auto t = - speed / acceleration ; // (x - x0) = (v0 * t) + (1/2)(a * t^2) return speed * t + 0.5 * acceleration * t * t ; } Here, we chose to separate out the construction of our quantity makers, so we could make the \u201creal\u201d line more concise and readable. This has no impact on performance either way, but in this case it makes the unit-safe handoffs easier to see at a glance. Do whatever makes your code the most readable! As for the \u201ccore logic\u201d implementation, note how it turns out to be much cleaner without the unit suffixes clogging up the variable name. It\u2019s also more robust. If you try introducing the same unit error we did up above, you should find that it gets caught at compile time. Summary \u00b6 This exercise showed how you can upgrade the unit safety of your codebase incrementally , without forcing huge changes across your project. You can provide a new, unit-safe API which coexists with the old one, which becomes a thin wrapper. You can migrate your clients independently in small batches. And when they\u2019re all migrated, simply delete the old one! Tip As you become more proficient with the library, you may prefer to skip straight to the second step, and turn the old function into the \u201cshim\u201d right away. This is generally a better approach.

Warning When composing unit type instances (like Meters{} ), we don\u2019t get the same fluency as when we compose quantity makers (like meters ). In particular, we can\u2019t offer the same grammatical fluency. With quantity makers, we would write meters / second . However, with unit type instances, we end up needing to write Meters{} / Seconds{} , rather than Meters{} / Second{} . Note that we also removed the suffixes (such as _m , _mps , and _mpss ) from the variable and function names. Those suffixes were there to help humans keep track of units. Now that\u2019s the compiler\u2019s job! If we rerun the tests now, we\u2019ll find we get a linker error rather than a compiler error. This makes sense: our function hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. Exercise 1(a) Task Solution and Discussion Go to 102_api_types.cc , and implement the function you had just declared. Your function implementation should amount to a thin wrapper on the existing function. First, we\u2019ll \u201cunwrap\u201d the input quantity parameters, giving us raw double values we can pass to the old version. Then, we\u2019ll \u201cwrap\u201d the answer with the appropriate quantity maker. Something like this inside of your \"tutorial/102_api_types.cc\" file should work: QuantityD < Meters > stopping_distance ( QuantityD < MetersPerSecond > speed , QuantityD < MetersPerSecondSquared > acceleration ) { return meters ( stopping_distance_m ( speed . in ( meters / second ), acceleration . in ( meters / squared ( second )))); } Notice how we have a unit-safe handoff on the output. We\u2019re passing the result of stopping_distance_m(...) to meters(...) , and we can see that the units match. We don\u2019t have a unit-safe handoff on the inputs . The only way to check they\u2019re correct is by carefully inspecting the order and comparing to the signature of stopping_distance_m() . Fortunately, that function lives in the same file, so it\u2019s not too onerous to verify the correctness. Reminder about .in(...) syntax The argument you pass needs to be an instance , not a type . It may be tempting to call speed.in(MetersPerSecond) , but that\u2019s not valid C++ (you can\u2019t \u201cpass a type\u201d to a function). That\u2019s why we passed the quantity maker instead: speed.in(meters / second) .","title":"Exercise 1: new interface shim"},{"location":"tutorial/exercise/102-api-types/#exercise-2-reverse-the-roles","text":"At this point, we\u2019re in pretty decent shape. We\u2019ve provided a unit-safe interface which anyone can take advantage of. And we\u2019ve left the old interface in place, so we haven\u2019t broken any existing clients! However, we can do a lot better. First, if you read the commentary in the previous section\u2019s solution, you\u2019ll know that the input parameters don\u2019t have a unit-safe handoff. That\u2019s a small problem. A bigger problem is that we\u2019re not taking full advantage of the units library in our implementation itself! To see why this matters, introduce a unit error by deleting the * t_s from the end of the implementation: return speed_mps * t_s + 0.5 * acceleration_mpss * t_s * t_s ; // Delete this---^^^^^^ Save the file and rerun all the tests. Even though the implementation is wrong, the tests all pass! Note that we\u2019re adding a distance and a speed here. If we were using quantities , the wrong code wouldn\u2019t even compile . (That said: in a real project, this would also be a good signal to add more test cases, too. ) Undo the error you introduced. Now you\u2019re ready to fix both these problems at once. Exercise 2 Task Solution and Discussion Reverse the roles of the functions. Use quantity types for the core logic . Turn the raw numeric version into the thin wrapper . All existing tests should pass without modification. Something like this inside of your \"tutorial/102_api_types.cc\" file should work: double stopping_distance_m ( double speed_mps , double acceleration_mpss ) { // Convenient ad hoc quantity makers, for readability. constexpr auto mps = meters / second ; constexpr auto mpss = meters / squared ( second ); return stopping_distance ( mps ( speed_mps ), mpss ( acceleration_mpss )). in ( meters ); } QuantityD < Meters > stopping_distance ( QuantityD < MetersPerSecond > speed , QuantityD < MetersPerSecondSquared > acceleration ) { // This first implementation uses only the most basic kinematic equations. // We could refactor it later to be more efficient. // t = (v - v0) / a const auto t = - speed / acceleration ; // (x - x0) = (v0 * t) + (1/2)(a * t^2) return speed * t + 0.5 * acceleration * t * t ; } Here, we chose to separate out the construction of our quantity makers, so we could make the \u201creal\u201d line more concise and readable. This has no impact on performance either way, but in this case it makes the unit-safe handoffs easier to see at a glance. Do whatever makes your code the most readable! As for the \u201ccore logic\u201d implementation, note how it turns out to be much cleaner without the unit suffixes clogging up the variable name. It\u2019s also more robust. If you try introducing the same unit error we did up above, you should find that it gets caught at compile time.","title":"Exercise 2: reverse the roles"},{"location":"tutorial/exercise/102-api-types/#summary","text":"This exercise showed how you can upgrade the unit safety of your codebase incrementally , without forcing huge changes across your project. You can provide a new, unit-safe API which coexists with the old one, which becomes a thin wrapper. You can migrate your clients independently in small batches. And when they\u2019re all migrated, simply delete the old one! Tip As you become more proficient with the library, you may prefer to skip straight to the second step, and turn the old function into the \u201cshim\u201d right away. This is generally a better approach. Return to the main tutorial page .","title":"Summary"}]}
